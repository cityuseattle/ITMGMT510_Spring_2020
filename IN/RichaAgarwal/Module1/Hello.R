#A high-level programming language (HLL) is designed to be used by a human 
#and is closer to the human language. Its programming style is easier to comprehend and implement 
#than a lower-level programming language (LLL). A high-level programming language needs to be converted 
#to machine language before being executed, so a high-level programming language can be slower.

#A low-level programming language, on the other hand, is a lot closer to the machine and computer language.
#A low-level programming language can be executed directly on computer without the need to convert between languages
#before execution. Thus, a low-level programming language can be faster than a high-level programming language. 
#Low-level programming languages like the assembly language are more inclined towards machine language 
#that deals with bits 0 and 1.
