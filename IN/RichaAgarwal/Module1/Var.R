#The code and scripts we used previously. we actually created two variables, A and B, and assigned some values
#to the two variables.
#A <- 1
#B <- 2
#In this code, A is a variable, and B is a variable also. <- means assign. A <- 1 means variable A is assigned a value of 1. 1 is a
#numeric type. B <- 2 means variable B is assigned a value of 2. 2 is a numeric type.


Var1 = 1    #Assign var1 to 1
Var2 = 2    #Assign var2 to 2

result = Var1 + Var2   #Adding var1 and var2 into result

print(result)  #print the output
